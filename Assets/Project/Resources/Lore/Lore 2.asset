  loreDescription: One week later, Anna accompanies Artyom on a trip to the surface
    and while traversing through a Hanza-restricted zone, they come across a functional
    train travelling through Moscow. The couple is subsequently captured by Hanza
    realizing that the outside world has survived for over 20 years, and two travellers
    have come to Moscow in search of their relative. The vehicle pulls over and the
    Hanza soldiers prepare to execute the two travellers before Artyom intervenes
    but he is shot and left for dead in a ravine filled with piles of dead bodies.
    Gravely wounded, Artyom manages to enter the Hanza outpost, and with the aid
    of the train driver, Yermak, is able to find Anna. It is revealed by the commander
    in the outpost that the war is still ongoing, and the outpost is a broadcast
    jammer, stopping anybody from contacting the outside world, and alerting any
    foreign powers about the people still alive in Moscow.
