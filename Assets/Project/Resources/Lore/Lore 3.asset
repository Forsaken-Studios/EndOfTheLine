  loreDescription: Artyom, Anna and Yermak devise a plan to steal the train to escape
    from Hanza and to warn the rest of the metro of the current situation. However,
    a Hanza-Spartan joint force led by Miller storms the train and capture the trio.
    Learning that the assailants are Anna and Artyom, Miller turns on the Hanza soldiers
    and hijacks the train to escape Moscow. They are intercepted by a heavily-armed
    Hanza armored train, but Artyom is able to sabotage it, allowing the Rangers
    to make a clean getaway.
