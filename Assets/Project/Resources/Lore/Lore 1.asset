  loreDescription: After the Battle for D6, Artyom along with his wife Anna, leave
    the Order to settle down at VDNKh station. However, Artyom's growing paranoia
    and his dreams of leaving the metro lead him to regularly go up to the surface
    to attempt to tune into any outside radio broadcasts. During one such expedition,
    Artyom, on his way to his home station, is wounded by a pack of watchmen and
    is narrowly saved by a small detachment of Rangers. Colonel Miller rebukes him
    for his frequent travels on the surface, and personally travels to Exhibition
    to offer Artyom and Anna a place in the order once again, this time training
    new recruits from the comfort of Polis.
