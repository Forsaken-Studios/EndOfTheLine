  description: Unleashes a burst of incredible speed, allowing you to move across
    the battlefield at breakneck pace for a short period of time. This rapid sprint
    can be used to close in on enemies, evade incoming threats, or reposition strategically
    in an instant. While sprinting, your agility is unmatched, but be mindful of
    obstacles and timing, as the effect is temporary.
