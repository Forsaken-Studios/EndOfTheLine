  name: Invisible Eyes
  description: Activates a cloak that renders you completely invisible to the naked
    eye for a limited duration. During this time, you can move undetected through
    enemy lines, setting up ambushes or escaping dangerous situations without being
    noticed. While invisible, enemies cannot target you directly, but certain actions,
    such as attacking, will reveal your position. Use this power wisely to outmaneuver
    your foes.
