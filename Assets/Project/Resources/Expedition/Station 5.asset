  stationDescription: 'Paveletskaya is unique in that its Hermetic Door, that should
    block the surface entrance, is missing, so every night the mutants of the surface
    come down to the station terrorizing and hunting every unfortunate soul who stay
    there. The city is below the main platform, and all guards have to defend the
    population from the "visitors" (the station''s slang for mutants). All attempts
    to close the "entrance" with steel plates were in vain, only walling it up with
    concrete could stop the monsters but for some reason Paveletskaya station never
    had a chance to do it.



    Due to the poor living standards and the open entrance
    allowing radiation into the station, both the water and air are heavily polluted.
    People who dare to inhabit the area are very weak, while children bare heavy
    signs of developed mutation (e.g. extra limbs or lack of fingers).'
