  missionName: Advanced search for red minerals
  missionDescription: This is a big one. I've found an even larger stash of red minerals
    that might interest you. The catch is, it's located on a heavily guarded base.
    If you feel specially lucky, I can send a team to collect it, but you know how
    the saying goes, the greater the risk, the greater the reward.
