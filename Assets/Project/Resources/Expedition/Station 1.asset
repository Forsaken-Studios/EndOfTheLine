  stationName: PETROVSKO
  stationDescription: 'By the year 2033, approximately 120 people lived in the station
    and their main occupation was farming - growing mushrooms and breeding pigs,
    two common food commodities in the Metro. When the harvest was good, inhabitants
    of PETROVSKO traded their products with the rest of the Metro, but the population
    of animals and fungi was regularly plagued with diseases, which often resulted
    in lowered production, only barely able to feed the people living in the station.



    In
    November 2033, PETROVSKO and VDNKh signed an agreement and formed a VDNKh Commonwealth,
    which was later also joined by Riga station. This noticeably improved conditions
    for the inhabitants of PETROVSKO, as lighting was installed in the tunnel leading
    to VDNKh, allowing for a safe connection between the two stations. A law enforcement
    unit was also established (which is described by Artyom in the Metro 2033 novel
    as "militia in simple uniforms with an "A" painted on the back"). Furthermore,
    the station received telephone connection with other stations in the Commonwealth.'
