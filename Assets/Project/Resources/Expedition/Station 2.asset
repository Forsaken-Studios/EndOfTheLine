  stationDescription: According to a legend told by the Rangers, there was an explosion
    in the tunnels leading to Kievskaya which buried some people alive. Some were
    said to have survived, but "no longer resemble humans". The Rangers was also
    told that there was a mysterious entity, which was some kind of fog. The mention
    of a collapsed tunnel and frightening beings on the other side could well be
    a reference to the Great Worm Children from the novel, who menaced the people
    of Kievskaya through a small hole in the cave-in. After Miller tells the story,
    Vladimir expresses doubt as to its veracity, and Ulman responds that Vladimir
    lost his family in the explosion but has no memory of what happened after. The
    station is not specifically seen during the game, but could possibly be somewhere
    between Sparta and the D6 outskirts. This would make sense given that the Rangers
    pass through to get to D6, but D6 is still quite far away, and they would still
    have to go through Park Pobedy.
