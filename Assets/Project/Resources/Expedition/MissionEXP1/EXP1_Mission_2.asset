  missionName: Search for purple minerals
  missionDescription: All right, you know this purple mineral is quite valuable,
    do you? I've managed to find some of it in an contraband storage, so the chances
    of it being heavily guarded aren't preciselly low. I can send a small team to
    try collecting some of it, but I can't guarantee you anything.
