  missionDescription: "This expedition leads into the dark, abandoned depths of an
    old metro station. Rumored to have been a fallout shelter, the station might
    contain hidden stockpiles of food, medical kits, and rare tools left behind by
    its last inhabitants. But beware\u2014the narrow tunnels are said to be unstable,
    and strange noises echo from the darkness. Some say creatures lurk below, drawn
    by any hint of light or sound. Equip yourself with a reliable light source and
    keep your team close; in these claustrophobic halls, losing your way could mean
    losing everything."
