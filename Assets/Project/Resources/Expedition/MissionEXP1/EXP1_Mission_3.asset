  missionName: Search for green minerals
  missionDescription: There's a rumour out there that someone is selling green minerals
    in the black market. I can gather a team to try bargaining for a few of them,
    though I can't guarantee you they'll come back with their hands empty, as there
    will probably be more fellas trying their luck with getting some of it.
