  stationName: POLIS
  stationDescription: Polis is formed by the Arbatskaya, Aleksandrovskiy Sad, Biblioteka
    Lenina, and Borovitskaya stations. Above ground is the Moscow State Library,
    formally known as Lenin Library. Throughout the Metro, Polis is known as a station
    with wealth and power. The platforms which encompass Polis seem to have been
    taken up by various machinery, with near building-like structures taking the
    place of housing. In the novel, there is a caste system consisting of the Shudra,
    who are the servants, the Vashiya, a group of dedicated Polis merchants, Kshatriya,
    the former Russian Army, special forces, or Government agents who make up the
    defense force, and finally Brahmins, who are the pre-war scientists, teachers,
    and other important keepers of knowledge.
