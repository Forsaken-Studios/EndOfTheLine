  stationDescription: 'The station is considered by its inhabitants a small Sparta,
    as every inhabitant from the youngest to the oldest is trained to fight. The
    reason is simple: the engineers of the station produce more than two thirds of
    the electricity of the Metro, through underground hydroelectric plants. Unfortunately,
    most of the generators are located south of the hermetic door, which means it
    must remain open, and so hordes of mutants attack Sevastopolskaya Station regularly.'
